# The Godhunter
I sometimes update this mod   
**The mod wasn't multiplier proof tested** (and likely never will).

I started this mod 4 years ago and it is still extremly unpolished. I don't have much time to work on it, and when I do,it is just to add another weird idea that will likely have no texture for way too long...

Anyway, it is time to add new things, and (maybe) finaly make some textures !!\
_(I'm secretly hoping that what I have in mind can actually be made)_
